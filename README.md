# Radiant Enhancement Proposals (REPs)

Radiant Enhancement Proposals (REPs) are design documents providing information to the Radiant community, or describing a new feature for Radiant or its processes or environment. REPs are the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting design decisions.
